# grepr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

grepr aims to provide a similar functionality as the bash command `grep`,
but display the results as RStudio source markers

## Installation

You can install the developent version of grepr from GitHub with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("GregorDeCillia/grepr")
```

## Example

This package exposes one single function called `grepr`, which finds matches
based on a regular expression.

```{r}
library(grepr)
grepr(pattern = "message") %>% as.data.frame() %>% head(3)
```

If `grepr` is called in RStudio, the results are displayed as RStudio markers.

## Arguments

Argument           | Description
-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------
**pattern**        | a character string containing a regular expression
**dir**            | a directory from which the search is conducted. Defaults to the working directory.
**ignore_dotfiles**| should hidden files be searched as well? Defaults to `FALSE`
**file_pattern**   | a regular expression which can be used to exclude certain files from the search
